# DimensionDash-Game
Here is everything for the dimension dash game. To find the code for the game you will need to go to assets then find the file which is labeled scripts. 
From there you are able to see all the scripts that were used. DISCLAIMER* There are also some scripts that were never used because they did not fit the final build. 
The files that weren't used were as following:
CameraController.cs
MultiplayerManager.cs
StickPlatform.cs
New_Finish.cs

The game is also meant to be placed on 1920 x 1080 screen and also made for only windows computers due to security reasons from Apple Admin Permissions. 
If not played on the proper display, certain things will act up and not appear like the skins. You can still pick them, you won't be able to tell which one you are however.

Disclaimer* Due To The Game Being More That 25 MB I can unable to upload the files here.
