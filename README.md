# DimensionDash-Game
Here is everything for the dimension dash game. To find the code for the game you will need to go to assets then find the file which is labeled scripts. 
From there you are able to see all the scripts that were used. DISCLAIMER* There are also some scripts that were never used because they did not fit the final build. 
The files that weren't used were as following:
CameraController.cs
MultiplayerManager.cs
StickPlatform.cs
New_Finish.cs
